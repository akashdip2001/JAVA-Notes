===================
Trainer: Mr. Raghab

Todays topics
=============
1) Full stack Development
2) who attend this course: any one
3) pre requisite: No only your time and dedication and hard work
==========================
*) Full Stack Developer
-----------------------
=> Developer who is expert in multiple areas of Project development is called Full Stack Developer.

=> Frontend(Client Side development),Backend(Server side development),
Database(SQL),DevOps knowledge(basic -> Dev tools), AWS

=> Frontend(HTML,CSS,JavaScript,Frontend Frameworks) + Backend(JavaScript,    Java, .NET, Python, PHP) 

=> Backend Java -> Full Stack Java Developer
           Python -> Full Stack Python Developer
	   .NET   -> Full stack .NET Developer
	   JavaScript -> Full stack web Developer

================================================================================================================================================
Full Stack Java Development
===========================
1. Backend : 
============
	Core Java (Java SE)   SE:: Standered Edition
	Adv Java (Java EE)    EE:: Enterprise Edition
	Frameworks(Spring -> Spring Boot) 
	Design Pattern
2. DB Knowdledge
================
	SQL(MySQL or PostgreSQL)

3. UI/UX
=========
	HTML5,CSS,BootStrap,JS,JQuery,React.JS,Angular

4. DevOps
=========
	Git,GitHub,Maven,Docker,k8s,Jenkins,Agile Jira,Sonar Qube,Nexus,Jfrog...Eclipse,IntelliJ

5. AWS
=======
Deploy and take services from cloud provider



Freshers:Core Java + Collection Frameworks + DSA with Java + Adv Java(JDBC,Servlet,JSP) + Spring(Core,Context,AOP,web MVC,Data JPA,Cloud,Security...20+) + Spring Boot

=====================
Programming Language:
=====================
=> It is installable software providing basic feature of application development.
=> It acts as raw material for software Programming

=> It provides Compiler or Interpreter to check syntaxes(rules) and Semantics(structure) of the given program.

=> It acts as base for creating Technology, Frameworks, Operating System, DB softwares

=> Ex: C, C++ , C#, Java etc

Note: Python is not a Programming Language
->It is scripting language.
->It runs on the top of other programming lang like : C, C++ , Scripts(Perl,shell..)

==========
Technology
==========
=> It is a software specification providing set of rules and guidelines in the form of API's(Application Programming Interface) to create implementation software using one or more programming language.

Ex: JDBC, Servlet, JSP

Drawbacks: Common logic + Business logic

=========
Framework
=========
=> Framework is a Semi-developed Softwar
=> It is installable software that is built on the top of one or more Teechnologies(Java EE/Jakarta EE)

=> Framework is a installable software that provides abstraction(hiding the details/implementation) to simplyfy the process of application development

=> It provides common logic and you no need to write any same logic again and again ony business logic.

Ex: Spring,Spring Boot, Hibernate, Strats..


PL ====> 100%
Technology ======> 70% + 30%(Technology/API)
Frameworks ======> 15% + 85%(Framework)
